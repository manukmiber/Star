## 2026-08-20 — Fase 2: Tarik data Tier 1 + Tier 2

Ran `astro pull --all --tier 1` then `astro pull --all --tier 2` (user
explicitly approved skipping the Tier 2 "report size, wait for
confirmation" pause — "gede juga gapapa, langsung pull aja"). Both via
`astro_datalake/downloaders.py` (new), wired into a now-real `astro pull`
CLI command (was a stub in Fase 0).

**Tier 1: 32/37 sources pulled, 0 errors, 5 deliberately skipped, ~421MB.**
**Tier 2: 4/6 sources pulled, 0 errors, 2 deliberately skipped, +~300MB.**
**Total raw data: ~723MB across 36 source folders.**

Deliberately skipped (documented per-source in `registry.py` notes, not
silent failures):
- `simbad_tap`, `vizier_tap` — access points used ad-hoc (crossmatch,
  per-catalog queries already covered by wds/msc/sb9), not bulk-dumped.
- `spacetrack`, `ucs_satellite_db` — require credentials/registration not
  available in this environment.
- `open_exoplanet_catalogue` — thousands of small per-system XML files on
  a GitHub repo outside this session's repo-access scope; would also mean
  thousands of individual 1 req/s requests. Needs a `git clone` done
  outside this constraint, or the repo added via `add_repo`.
- `usgs_gazetteer`, `gaia_dr3_nss` — Tier 2 but no download plan written
  yet (Gazetteer is per-body GIS shapefiles, not a flat table; Gaia NSS
  blocked by the same ESA 503 as `gaia_dr3_tap`, see Fase 1 notes).

Spot-checked (not fabricated, straight from the live responses):
HYG = 119,627 rows; `pscomppars` = 6,337 planets; SBDB `MBA.json` returned
exactly 1,378,000 rows matching its own `count` field (API did not
truncate); `MPCORB.DAT.gz` passes `gzip -t`.


Format: newest entry first. Every dead/changed endpoint discovered during
probing (Fase 1) or later gets logged here with the date, what was tried,
and what replaced it (if anything).

## 2026-08-20 — Fase 1: Probe endpoint

Ran `uv run python -m astro_datalake.probe` against all 46 registered
sources (small GET with `limit=5`/`top 5` where applicable, or HEAD).
Results written to `data/_catalog/sources.json` (gitignored, regenerable).

**43/46 alive, 2 dead (both same root cause), 1 skipped (needs credentials).**

Fixes applied to `astro_datalake/sources/registry.py` for endpoints that
were dead or wrong on the first pass:

- **`hyg_database`** — 404. The guessed filename `hyg_v42.csv` doesn't
  exist. Correct current file: `hygdata_v41.csv` (HYG v4.1) at
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/astronexus/HYG-Database/main/hyg/CURRENT/hygdata_v41.csv`.
  Fixed.
- **`iau_star_names`** — 404 (the `iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/`
  page redirects through a login flow and 404s on direct fetch). Replaced
  with the **IAU-CSN** (IAU Catalog of Star Names) machine-readable file
  maintained by the IAU Division C Working Group on Star Names itself at
  `https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/WGSN/IAU-CSN.txt` — notably,
  this file's own header cites the iau.org page as "the official IAU
  version," so it's the same data, just the actually-fetchable copy.
  Fixed.
- **`kepler_eb_catalog`** — 400 Bad Request over plain `http://`; the
  Villanova server accepts `https://` fine (200) but 500s on the
  `/results/?q=1` guess. Fixed the scheme; the real query-parameter format
  for `/results/` still needs to be reverse-engineered from the site before
  Fase 2 writes a real downloader for it (probe now just checks the
  homepage is up).
- **`msc_catalog`** — 400, "table J/ApJS/235/6/table1 is not found". Queried
  `TAP_SCHEMA.tables` on TAPVizieR and found the real table names for this
  catalog: `catalog`, `notes`, `orbits`, `systems`. Fixed to use
  `J/ApJS/235/6/catalog`.
- **`exoplanet_eu`** — looked dead (`ReadTimeout` at 20s) but is just slow:
  a plain GET streamed 1.5MB+ within 25s and was still going. Not dead;
  added a per-source `probe_timeout` override (45s) and switched
  `base_url`/`probe_url` from `http://` to `https://` (the `http://` URL
  301-redirects to `https://` anyway).

Still dead / unresolved:

- **`gaia_dr3_tap`** (Tier 3) and **`gaia_dr3_nss`** (Tier 2) — both
  `HTTP 503` from `gea.esac.esa.int`. Confirmed it's not a wrong URL: even
  the plain archive homepage (`gea.esac.esa.int/archive/`) timed out on
  retry, which points to an ESA-side outage/maintenance window, not a dead
  endpoint. Neither is needed for Tier 1, so this doesn't block Fase 2 —
  re-check before any Tier 2/3 pull that touches Gaia.
- **`spacetrack`** — skipped by design (requires a free account;
  `ASTRO_DL_SPACETRACK_USER`/`PASS` not set in this environment).

Also: created GitHub branch `main` from the Fase 0 commit (the repository
had zero branches/commits before this project), so the feature branch has
a base to open a PR against.

## 2026-08-20 — Fase 0: Scaffold

- Initial project scaffold: CLI (`astro pull|build|verify|status`), config,
  rate-limited/retrying HTTP client, checksum-based raw cache, folder-naming
  helpers, and the master source registry (`astro_datalake/sources/registry.py`)
  covering all sources listed in the task brief (sections A–H).
- No network calls made yet. Endpoint liveness has **not** been verified —
  that's Fase 1, next.
- Tier assignments in the registry are a best-effort mapping of the brief's
  Tier 1/2/3 lists onto concrete endpoints; a few sources not explicitly
  named in those lists (USGS Gazetteer, IAU star names, Gaia DR3 NSS,
  OpenNGC/Messier) carry a `notes` field explaining the assumption made and
  are flagged for reconsideration in the Fase 5 report.
