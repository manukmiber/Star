# Astro Data Lake

Local astronomical data lake: pulls astronomy data from official public
sources, normalizes it, and organizes it into a per-object/per-system folder
structure under `data/`.

## Ground rules

- Never fabricate scientific data. A missing field is `null`, and every
  value traces back to a source (`metadata.json` in each leaf folder).
- Every raw download is cached by checksum and never overwritten; raw
  responses live untouched under `data/raw/<source>/<date>/`.
- Requests are rate-limited (default 1 req/s per domain) with exponential
  backoff retry, and identify themselves with a clear `User-Agent`.
- Heavy pulls (Tier 2/3, see below) never run without explicit confirmation.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

## CLI

```bash
astro pull <source>        # pull one source (see `astro status` for keys)
astro pull --all --tier 1  # pull every source in a tier
astro build                # normalize raw -> processed folder structure
astro verify                # checksum / row-count / empty-folder / schema checks
astro status                 # summary: what's been pulled, sizes, dates
```

└── deep_sky/        # messier, ngc, ic, nebulae, galaxies (tier 3)
```

`data/` (except `data/_catalog/schema/`) is gitignored — it's generated
output, regenerated with `astro pull` + `astro build`, not versioned.

## Tiering

- **Tier 1** (~hundreds of MB): runs without asking — planets, moons,
  exoplanets (all tables), HYG stars, binary catalogs (WDS/SB9/MSC), active
  artificial satellites, NEO asteroids + Sentry + close-approach data.
- **Tier 2** (~5-20 GB): reports an estimated size and waits for
  confirmation — full MPCORB (~1.4M asteroids), full SBDB (all classes),
  full SATCAT, Kepler/TESS lightcurve metadata.
- **Tier 3** (hundreds of GB-TB): never runs without an explicit, separate
  instruction — full Gaia DR3 source catalog, FITS/photo data, raw
  lightcurves. Default subset when it does run: parallax > 10 mas OR G < 12.

See `astro_datalake/sources/registry.py` for the exact source -> tier
mapping and `CHANGELOG.md` for endpoint verification results.

## Status

Project is being built phase by phase (see CHANGELOG.md). Current phase:
**Fase 0 — scaffold** (this commit). No data has been pulled yet.
